Overview:
    I have models { Comment, Conversation, Group, Message, Tweet, User } and some pages
    each page takes Print and Scan and User
    if the page is about other users or tweets it will take them too
    the main functions are in User
    FileHandler Saves, loads and uses files.
    Filter is made to find, delete, return index
    Models Tweet and Users are saved
    ProfileFields takes profile Fields and validates them
    date formatter changes the datetime to String
    util Package is usually for functions that get used but not related to users
    Pages are all the Pages needed
    2 classes are for the next phase (ServerAgent, UserOther) for better security and privacy
    each retweet is a tweet
    each comment is a extend of a tweet
    Conversation is a place holder for messages
    in Filehandler I open objects one by one but once I open it I dont open it
